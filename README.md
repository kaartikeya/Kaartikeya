Hi there, Namaste! My name is Kaartikeya Srivastava and I am a B.Tech CSE graduate.

I am a Software Developer with approximately six months of hands-on experience in creating scalable, reactive, and functional websites. I am proficient in languages such as C++, Java, and JavaScript. Currently, I am working with React.js and Google Firebase, and I have also built full-stack projects using the MERN stack.

As a Software Developer at a budding startup, I have the opportunity to work on multiple projects and take on various responsibilities beyond development. These include building websites and their UI, handling APIs, integrating with the backend, maintaining databases, and performing low-level unit testing. I also coordinate with project clients, understand their requirements, provide periodic project progress walkthroughs, and strive to exceed expectations with every delivery.

I am a dedicated individual with strong and clear communication skills. My hobbies like debating, public speaking,  reading, and writing blogs enhance my precision, confidence, and ability to articulate ideas effectively. I am easy to work with as I respect personal space and focus on my responsibilities. At the same time, I collaborate effectively and contribute to achieving the best team outcomes.

P.S. Caffeine and friendly debate are always on the table.
